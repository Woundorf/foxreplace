<!ENTITY p "This extension allows you to replace text fragments (strings) in a page by other text fragments. The system is based on substitutions, where each substitution has an input text which has to be replaced (the &quot;Replace&quot; field) and an output text by which the first has to be replaced (the &quot;With&quot; field). There are additional options for the substitutions that are explained below. When a substitution is applied it's over the whole content of a page (you can't do partial substitutions at the moment).">

<!ENTITY substitutionList "Substitution list">
<!ENTITY substitutionList.p "FoxReplace keeps a substitution list that you can define and modify at any moment from the FoxReplace options window. You can apply the substitution list when you want by pressing the F2 key or by pushing the toolbar button or activating a menu option. When you do, substitutions in the list will be applied in the order in which they appear. You can apply the substitution list as many times as you want over the same page. Substitutions are done over the current content of the page, i.e. if you apply the substitution list a second time, it will be over the result of the first. In this substitution list there aren't the substitutions directly, but there are substitution groups, where a list of addresses (URLs) is associated with a list of substitutions which are applied to pages whose address matches one of the URLs in the list.">
<!ENTITY substitutionGroup "Substitution group">
<!ENTITY substitutionGroup.p0 "It's formed by an URL list and a substitution list. The substitutions are applied in the order they appear, and there must be one at least. With the URL list you can define to which pages the substitutions are applied. If the list is empty, the substitutions are applied to any page. You can add URLs and then the substitutions are applied only if the page address matches one of the URLs. Finally, you can also add exclusion URLs which have the opposite effect, the substitutions aren't applied if the page address matches one of them. So, if the URL list isn't empty, the substitutions are applied if the page address doesn't match any of the exclusion URLs and matches one of the normal URLs. The URL of a page is considered to match an URL of the group if the URL of the group is part of the URL of the page.">
<!ENTITY substitutionGroup.p1 "The exclusion URLs are the ones that start with a hyphen (&quot;-&quot;), and they are displayed in red; the rest are normal URLs. You may use special characters &quot;*&quot; to match any 0 or more characters and &quot;|&quot; to match the beginning or the end of the URL. If you want to define an URL that starts with a hyphen (i.e. &quot;-abc&quot;) and it isn't an exclusion URL, you may use the equivalent form &quot;|*-abc&quot;.">
<!ENTITY replaceHtml "Replace HTML">
<!ENTITY replaceHtml.p "Substitutions are usually applied only to the text, but there's also the option of doing it to the HTML code of the page. This allows to modify the format or the page structure. You can set or unset this option for every group in the substitution list.">
<!ENTITY autoReplace "Auto-replace on page load">
<!ENTITY autoReplace.p "This option can be activated or deactivated. When it's on, the substitution list is applied automatically when a page is loaded, applying the substitutions of the groups with a matching URL. This way the extension can work as a filter for the pages you want.">
<!ENTITY replaceUrls "Replace URLs">
<!ENTITY replaceUrls.p "This option is off by default. It it's on, substitutions are also applied to the URLs in the page (links, image sources, etc.), so it may change the behaviour of the page. Use it under your own responsibility. This has no effect in HTML substitutions, because then URLs can be modified always.">
<!ENTITY replaceScripts "Replace scripts">
<!ENTITY replaceScripts.p "This option is off by default. If it's on, substitutions are also applied to the scripts in the page, so it may change the behaviour of the page. Use it under your own responsibility. For substitutions with HTML in the input and the output this option applies to all the scripts, otherwise only to the scripts in the body.">
